    <h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>
    
    <p>
        This Refund and Cancellation Policy outlines how you can cancel or seek a refund for a product/service that you have purchased through the Platform.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Cancellation</h2>
    <p>
        Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made within <strong>1 day</strong> of placing the order. 
        However, cancellation requests may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the sellers/merchants listed on the Platform and they have initiated the process of shipping them, or if the product is out for delivery. 
        In such an event, you may choose to reject the product at the doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
        ddocksolutions does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. 
        However, a refund or replacement can be made if the user establishes that the quality of the product delivered is not good.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Defective, Damaged or Incorrect Products</h2>
    <p>
        In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the issue to our customer service team. 
        The request will be entertained once the seller/merchant listed on the Platform has checked and confirmed the same at their end. 
        This must be reported within <strong>1 day</strong> of receipt of the products.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or does not meet your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer service team within <strong>1 day</strong> of receiving the product. 
        The customer service team, after investigating your complaint, will take an appropriate decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        For complaints regarding products that come with a manufacturer’s warranty, please refer the issue directly to the manufacturer.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>
        In case of any refunds approved by ddocksolutions, it will take <strong>5 days</strong> for the refund to be processed and credited to you.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Returns</h2>
    <p>
        Returns will be accepted under the conditions mentioned above for cancellations, defective/damaged products, or incorrect items. 
        All return requests must adhere to the timelines and procedures outlined in this policy.
